# Connect Four

***Connect Four*** 

The real-world Connect Four was originally designed by Howard Wexler and Ned Strongin in 1974.

In game theory this game is a solved game; the first player can always win if they play optimally.

The tokens displayed are based on coins, silver octopus litra from Siciliy 460 BCE, and a Korean coin from the 1800s CE.

Play this with a friend at your computer. Take turns placing tokens by clicking a hole. Start with the bottom row, but once a token is placed, another can be placed on the hole above it.

Connect four of your tokens in a line to win, whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally, while preventing your opposed player from winning first.

**Next Steps:**
* Highlight winning row
* Animations for disc dropping
* Coordinate based event listening on columns of board image
* Computer driven player 2
* Multiplayer at a distance
